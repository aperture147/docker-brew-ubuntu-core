# This is a synced-fork, nothing personal will be made

This fork is dedicated to automated build on [quay.io](quay.io) to [mitigate the impact of Docker Hub Pull Request Limits](https://docs.docker.com/docker-hub/download-rate-limit/). Only the branch `dist-amd64` is continuously updated. Only `bionic` and `focal` are automatically build.
This fork is being kept up-to-date by the [Pull app](https://github.com/apps/pull). Please check and star the [wei/pull](https://github.com/wei/pull) project for keeping this synced with the upstream.
