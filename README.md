# This is a synced-fork, nothing personal will be made

This fork is dedicated to automated build on [quay.io](quay.io) to [mitigate the impact of Docker Hub Pull Request Limits](https://docs.docker.com/docker-hub/download-rate-limit/). Only the branch `dist-amd64` is continuously updated. Only `bionic` and `focal` are automatically build.
